# Admin Dashboard Database Integration

## Overview
Connected the admin dashboard from static/fake data to real-time database queries. The dashboard now displays actual application statistics, user counts, and recent submissions from the Supabase database.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New API Route
**File**: `iskolar/app/api/admin/dashboard/route.ts`

**Purpose**: Central endpoint for fetching all dashboard analytics data

**Data Retrieved**:
- Total applications count
- Applications grouped by status (pending, submitted, under_review, approved, rejected, withdrawn)
- Pending applications count (needs review)
- Total registered users count
- Recent 10 applications with full details (user info, semester, school year, barangay, school)

**Key Features**:
- Joins `application_details` with `users`, `semesters`, and `school_years` tables
- Aggregates status counts for charts and metrics
- Includes error handling and detailed logging
- Returns properly formatted data matching dashboard expectations

### 2. Updated Dashboard Page
**File**: `iskolar/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Changes**:
- **BEFORE**: Used static sample data with hardcoded values (248 applications, 312 users, etc.)
- **AFTER**: Fetches real data from `/api/admin/dashboard` endpoint via `useEffect` hook

**Benefits**:
- Real-time data updates on page load
- Error handling with user-friendly alerts
- Loading states maintained for better UX
- Console logging for debugging

## Database Schema Used

### Tables Queried:
1. **`application_details`**
   - `appdet_id` (application ID)
   - `status` (pending, approved, rejected, etc.)
   - `created_at` (submission timestamp)
   - `semester_id`, `user_id`

2. **`users`**
   - `first_name`, `last_name`
   - `email_address`
   - `barangay`
   - `college_university` (school name)

3. **`semesters`**
   - `name` (FIRST, SECOND)
   - `school_years` (foreign key join)

4. **`school_years`**
   - `academic_year` (e.g., 2025)

}
```

## Dashboard Metrics Connected

### Top Cards (Key Metrics):
1. ✅ **Total Applications** - Real count from `application_details` table
2. ✅ **Needs Review** - Sum of pending + submitted + under_review statuses
3. ✅ **Approved** - Count of approved applications with approval rate percentage
4. ✅ **Registered Users** - Real count from `users` table

### Charts & Breakdowns:
1. ✅ **Status Breakdown Bar Chart** - Uses `applicationsByStatus` data
2. ✅ **Priority Actions Panel** - Shows real pending count and approval/rejection ratios

### Recent Applications Table:
- ✅ Shows last 10 real applications with:
  - Applicant name and email
  - Barangay and school
  - Status (with color-coded badges)
  - Submission date
  - Action buttons (Review/View)

## Testing Checklist

### Before Testing:
- [ ] Ensure Supabase is running and accessible
- [ ] Verify `.env` has correct `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- [ ] Check that admin user is authenticated

### Test Cases:
1. **Dashboard Loads Successfully**
   - [ ] Navigate to `/admin/dashboard`
   - [ ] Verify loading spinner appears briefly
   - [ ] Check that all metric cards show numbers (not "0" if data exists)

2. **Data Accuracy**
   - [ ] Compare "Total Applications" with actual database count
   - [ ] Verify "Needs Review" matches pending applications
   - [ ] Check recent applications table shows latest submissions

3. **Error Handling**
   - [ ] Disconnect from internet/database
   - [ ] Verify alert message appears: "Failed to load dashboard data..."
   - [ ] Check console for detailed error logs

4. **Real-Time Updates**
   - [ ] Submit a new application as a scholar
   - [ ] Refresh admin dashboard
   - [ ] Verify count increases and application appears in recent list

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Dashboard shows 0 for all metrics
**Cause**: No data in database OR API endpoint failing
**Solution**: 
1. Check browser console for API errors
2. Verify database has applications: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM application_details;`
3. Check network tab for 500 errors in `/api/admin/dashboard` request

### Issue: "Failed to load dashboard data" alert
**Cause**: API error or authentication issue
**Solution**:
1. Check server console logs for detailed error message
2. Verify Supabase connection in `lib/supabaseClient.ts`
3. Ensure RLS policies allow admin access to tables

### Issue: Recent applications show "N/A" for barangay/school
**Cause**: User profile data not fully filled
**Solution**: This is expected for incomplete profiles. No fix needed.

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 (Optional):
1. **Real Barangay/Course/School Charts**
   - Replace static sample data in bar chart breakdowns
   - Query aggregated data by barangay, course, and school
   - Update `getChartData()` to use real counts

2. **Applications by Semester**
   - Implement `applicationsBySemester` aggregation
   - Show trend over multiple semesters
   - Add semester filter dropdown

3. **Auto-Refresh**
   - Add setInterval to refresh data every 30 seconds
   - Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
   - Show "Updated X seconds ago" timestamp

4. **Advanced Metrics**
   - Average processing time per application
   - Approval rate by barangay/school
   - Monthly application trends graph

## Developer Notes

### Why Service Role Key?
The API route uses the standard Supabase client, which respects RLS (Row Level Security) policies. Admin users should have appropriate permissions set in the database.

### Why Not Direct Supabase Client on Frontend?
Using an API route provides:
- Centralized data aggregation logic
- Better error handling and logging
- Easier to optimize with caching later
- Keeps sensitive queries server-side

### Performance Considerations
Current implementation makes 4+ separate queries. Future optimization could:
- Use SQL views for pre-aggregated stats
- Implement Redis caching for dashboard data
- Add pagination for recent applications if needed

## Success Criteria
✅ Dashboard loads with real data from database  
✅ All 4 key metrics display accurate counts  
✅ Recent applications table shows latest 10 submissions  
✅ Status breakdown chart reflects actual application distribution  
✅ No console errors when loading dashboard  
✅ Error handling works when API fails
